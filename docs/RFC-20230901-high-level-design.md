# Principles

- Native: Browser bookmark bar provides hierarchy, navigation, storage and sync
- Headless: Background script for feed fetching, scraping, and bookmark manipulation
- Interop: Bookmark can interop with other systems

# Ideas

- Background page can update feeds on browser start
- User can perform on-demand sync
- Merge with existing bookmarks, with limit on total count
- Read receipt tracking with microcopy (e.g. "*" prefix for unread articles)
- Customize folder name per feed
- Customize retention policy per feed
- Config sources in a single file (yaml, opml, json, xml)
- Use one of the bookmarks as source of feeds
- Use external URL as source of feeds
- Add current page to feed
